## Figure S.Hab.10.3.

A figure showing the amount of eelgrass in Frenchy's Cove, Anacapa Island, from 2004 - 2016. 

### `details`

Eelgrass cover at Frenchy’s Cove from 2004 to 2016 after 2003 transplant. Data are collected from diver surveys along a 30 meter fixed transect with points scored every 10 centimeters. The transect lies within the transplant area at Frenchy's Cove are at approximately 24 feet in depth. Declines in eelgrass cover are thought to be potentially due to seafloor disturbance from anchoring and trap fishing. Figure: [J. Altstatt/UCSB and NOAA](http://msi.ucsb.edu/people/project-staff/jessie%C2%A0altstatt)

Traffic patterns of large commercial vessels (cargo and tanker vessels) in the Santa Barbara Channel region for 2008, 2010, and 2014. The number of commercial ship transits is shown, using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data transmitted from ships. Vessels transiting to and from the Ports of Los Angeles/Long Beach that pass by the northern Channel Islands use either the Santa Barbara Channel Traffic Separation Scheme around the north side of the islands, or take routes south of the islands. Data source: USCG AIS data, processed by NMFS; Figure: MSWGSS 2016

## Figure App.C.4.13.

A graph showing noise levels in the Santa Barbara Channel from 2007 - 2016. 40Hz bands are shown in red, 90Hz bands are shown in blue. 

Ambient noise levels in the Santa Barbara Channel represented as monthly averages for 40 Hz (red) and 90 Hz (blue) bands. The decline in ambient noise levels observed between 2007 and 2010 reflects decreased regional shipping activity during that time. While ambient noise has increased since 2010, it has not returned to the higher levels observed in 2007 to 2008. Data sources: McKenna et al. 2012, J. Hildebrand/ UCSD unpub. data; Figure: [J.

## Figure App.D.7.3.

A map showing an unprecedented West Coast-wide [harmful algal bloom (HAB)](https://github.com/marinebon/cinms/blob/master/modals/_glossary.md) that extended from the Gulf of Alaska to southern California. March 2015 (left, before the HAB) as compared to May (right, during the HAB). 

In May 2015, an unprecedented West Coast-wide harmful algal bloom (HAB) extended from the Gulf of Alaska to southern California. The bloom was composed of _Pseudo-nitzschia_, a toxigenic diatom that has the ability to produce domoic acid, a potent neurotoxin that can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) and threaten human health if affected shellfish are consumed. These satellite images show chlorophyll-a estimates averaged over the periods of March 27–31, 2015 (left panel), and May, 6–8, 2015 (right panel). Data source: Satellite data were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) using a combination of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) chlorophyll products. Data were processed using standard OBPG processing with 4 kilometer imagery. Figure: McCabe et al. 2016

1984 to 2015 giant kelp biomass aerial extent varies seasonally and annually, with data showing high variation over three decades; however, recent data suggests kelp biomass as is near an all time low. Figure: [R. Miller/UCSB](https://msi.ucsb.edu/people/research-scientists/robert-miller)

## Figure App.E.10.14.

A figure showing the density of giant kelp across all five Sanctuary islands from 2005 to 2016. 

Giant kelp (*Macrocystis pyrifera*) density from 2005 to 2016 at all five sanctuary islands as counted by the national park subtidal surveys. Kelp density is currently at extreme lows for the three western islands, but the warmer islands (Anacapa and Santa Barbara islands) have recently experienced sharp increases in kelp density. Figure: [Channel Islands National Park](https://www.nps.gov/chis/index.htm)

## Figure App.E.10.20.

A figure showing the area covered by brown algae at two sites on Santa Cruz Island from 2000 to 2015. 

Brown algae percent cover from [LTER](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/) subtidal surveys at Santa Cruz Island (two sites, dark blue) and the mainland (nine sites, light blue) are shown in the trendlines above. Brown algae has been in decline since 2010 and is near record lows in the Santa Barbara Channel both at the mainland and in the sanctuary. Data source: SBC LTER; Figure: [R.

## Figure App.E.10.22.

A map showing eelgrass bed locations around the Northern Channel Islands. 

CINMS eelgrass bed locations in the map above are a compilation from UCSB, NMFS, and CINMS data. Surveys for eelgrass occurred at different times and the bed persistence is unknown at many locations. UCSB data comes from transects performed by UCSB researchers while the NMFS data comes from sidescan sonar surveys along the coastline. Data source: NMFS, UCSB, and CINMS; Map: [M. Cajandig/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/cajandig.html)

## Figure App.E.10.24.

A map showing eelgrass beds mapped by diver surveys on Anacapa Island in 2009 (light blue) and 2012 (dark red). 

Eelgrass bed extent from diver surveys at Anacapa Island in 2009 (light blue) and 2012 (dark red). Overall, bed extent appears to be declining at Anacapa between 2009 and 2012, with the eastern bed being extirpated. Trap fishing, anchoring, and seafloor disturbance are thought to contribute to declines in bed extent and shoot density, with eelgrass beds inside the marine reserve having higher shoot density than those in areas with less protection. Data source: J. Altstatt/ UCSB and CINMS; [Map: M. Cajandig/NOAA](https://channelislands.noaa.gov/contact/cajandig.html)

## Figure App.E.10.25.

A map showing eelgrass beds on Santa Cruz Island from a 2015 survey using sidescan sonar. 

National Marine Fisheries Service surveys in 2015 for eelgrass using interferometric sidescan sonar to map bed extent are shown. Dark blue represents bathylines generated from the sidescan data and area surveyed. Turquoise areas represents eelgrass bed extent generated from sidescan data. Eelgrass beds in these areas are thought to have persisted for long periods of time and appear to be relatively stable; however, surveys on the eelgrass health and shoot density have not been conducted.

## Figure App.E.10.26.

A pie chart showing the number of deep-water soft corals observed in the Southern California Bight. Organisms are grouped by genus.

The breakdown for the number of deep-water soft corals colonies observed in each genus for the Southern California Bight. Among the 34,792 images collected by the SWFSC Sebastes ROV between 2003 and 2011 throughout the entire Southern California Bight, researchers observed a total of 5,419 colonies. Adelogorgia was most common with 1,832 colonies in 535 observations. _Eugorgia_ was second most common with 792 colonies in 436 observations. Figure: Etnoyer et al. 2015

## Figure App.E.10.28.

A figure showing different levels of damage on gorgonians on Anacapa Island as seen during remotely-operated-vehicle surveys (2005, 2009, and 2014). 

Percent of gorgonians showing different levels damage at Anacapa Island during ROV surveys in 2005, 2009, and 2014. By 2014, less than 30 percent of observed gorgonians at Anacapa Island had no recognizable damage. Interactions with fishing gear and increasing water temperatures are thought to contribute to the increases in observed gorgonian damage at Anacapa Island. Gorgonian populations at more western islands are thought to fare better compared to Anacapa due to cooler water and less fishing effort. Figure: [MARE](https://www.maregroup.org/)

## Figure App.E.10.29.

A figure showing the concentration of the mineral [aragonite](https://github.com/marinebon/cinms/blob/master/modals/_glossary.md) (a form of calcium carbonate) at different depths at Anacapa Island from 2007 - 2014. 

[Aragonite saturations](https://github.com/marinebon/cinms/blob/master/modals/_glossary.md) are shown at 75 meters (m) (green), 150 m (blue) and 300 m (red) at Anacapa Island. As pH of seawater decreases (e.g., from the deposition of atmospheric CO2), the saturation state of aragonite (Ωarg) decreases. Aragonite undersaturation (Ωarg < 1) favors dissolution over calcification, making it harder for organisms to make and maintain their shells or skeletons in the case of corals. In coastal upwelling zones, such as the California Current, the aragonite saturation state and depth are variable and shallow, respectively. With ocean acidification, aragonite saturation depths have shoaled over the past three decades and are now typically around 200 m in the California Current (Turi et al. 2016). At the local scale at Anacapa Island, the aragonite saturation depth has hovered around 130 m over the past eight years. As strong of a shoaling trend as at the California Current scale has not been seen. Instead, he usual seasonal variation but relatively stable aragonite saturation states over time (no trend), particularly in deep water, have been seen. Figure: Etnoyer et al. 2015

## Figure App.E.11.6.

A figure showing levels of cancer-causing petroleum-linked chemicals found in the Channel Islands (blue) and offshore sites (red).

Mean Total Extractables (TE) for individual Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons or PAHs are compared between Channel Islands (blue) and other offshore sites (red). PAHs are organic contaminants that are carcinogenic. [Invertebrate](https://github.com/marinebon/cinms/blob/master/modals/_glossary.md) species typically have limited ability to metabolize PAHs; however, they typically do not biomagnify because vertebrates can metabolize them more easily. Concentrations of PAHs are variable, but concentrations at CINMS are usually equivalent, if not lower than other offshore locations. There are multiple potential explanations for this finding, including limited spatial resolution, limited recent data, possible return to background levels consistent with the southern California mainland after remediation, or improved instrumentation and analytics that have been developed since data collection began. Due to this, more through research and data collection is required to confirm this trend. Figure: D.

## Figure App.E.11.9.

A map showing the relative impact of human activity on the seafloor across different regions of the Southern California Bight, using the Benthic Response Index as an indicator. 

The Southern California Water Research Project uses a diversity index of tolerant and sensitive [infauna](https://github.com/marinebon/cinms/blob/master/modals/_glossary.md), also known as the Benthic Response Index (BRI), to gauge the ecosystem impact from anthropogenic contamination. The map above shows the 2013 locations of samples and the BRI trends at each location. Previously, island sites were all considered 100 percent pristine (reference), but now roughly 70 percent of samples are considered degraded from that status. Decline in BRI was particularly prevalent around Santa Cruz Island. This decline in BRI was not mirrored in other regions in southern California. The most recent samples, collected in 2013, found that ten of the 15 sites in Channel Island National Marine Sanctuary had infaunal community compositions that were shifting towards species more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously.

## Figure App.E.11.10.

A figure showing the relative impact of human activity on the seafloor across different regions of the Southern California Bight, using the Benthic Response Index as an indicator. 

Comparisons of the Benthic Response Index (BRI), a diversity index of contaminant tolerant and sensitive infauna, among different regions of the Southern California Bight is shown. Island shelf sites (upper right) had been at reference levels (highest ranking) until 2013, when approximately 30 percent of sites were reclassified as low impact. Other regions in the bight did not experience such a large BRI decline as the island shelf, which indicates potential new impacts to sediments around southern California Islands. Figure: K. Schiff/[SCCWRP](https://www.sccwrp.org/)

## Figure App.E.11.11.

A map showing sediment sample locations and their respective Benthic Reponse Index sites from a 2013 Southern California Bight-wide survey. The Benthic Response Index is a measure of the impact of humans on the seafloor.

SCCWRP sediment sample locations and their respective Benthic Response Index (BRI) from the 2013 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. In order to create the BRI, infaunal invertebrate communities are characterized based on the proportion of taxa present in a sample that are sensitive to as opposed to tolerant of contaminant levels. Using a composite score of the infauna community, SCCRWP labels sample sites as reference, low impact, moderate impact, or high impact. Figure: K. Schiff/[SCCWRP](https://www.sccwrp.org/)

## Figure App.E.11.12.

A map showing DDT contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. 

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP’s 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. DDT is most prominent around the Ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Santa Monica Bay. DDT is a legacy contaminant, which means it persists in the environment long after introduction. A large amount of DDT in the bight came from the dumping of the contaminant by the Montrose Chemical Company off Palos Verdes until the early 1980s, which is why the surrounding areas have high DDT levels. CINMS is relatively far from the spill site and thus, has limited DDT concentrations in sediments. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

## Figure App.E11.13.

A map showing copper contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. 

Copper contaminant levels at sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP’s 2008 Bight wide survey are shown in the map. Copper is a heavy metal contaminant that in high concentrations can be toxic to living marine resources. Concentrations in CINMS are consistently low compared with other regions in the southern California Bight. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011.

## Figure App.E.11.14.

A map showing silver contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. 

Silver contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP’s 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. Silver is a heavy metal contaminant that in high concentrations can be toxic to living marine resources. Concentrations in CINMS and the Santa Barbara Channel are consistently low compared other regions in the Southern California Bight. High concentrations of silver appear to be clustered off the two largest population centers: Los Angeles and San Diego. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

## Figure App.E11.15.

A map showing the contaminent levels of Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (which are used as flame retardants) in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008. 

Sediment contaminant levels for Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the Southern California Bight are shown in the map above. These products are typically added to manufactured products as flame retardants. Concentrations of PBDEs are low at the islands compared to mainland areas. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

## Figure App.E.11.16.

A map showing pyrethroid (insecticide) contaminant levels in sediments collected across the Southern California Bight in 2008.

Pyrethroids contaminant levels in sediment sampling locations during SCCRWP’s 2008 bight-wide survey are shown in the map. Pyrethroids are typically pollutants coming from insecticide use. In recent years, there has been no agriculture on the islands and thus, pyrethroids are absent from CINMS sediments. Sediments adjacent to CINMS off Ventura have low levels of pyrethroids likely due to agriculture in that area. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

## Figure App.E.11.17.

A figure showing the amount of impacted sediment in varying categories of exposure to sediment contamination ("Cat") across five sites and three years. 

Percent area of impacted sediments by stratum and survey year in varying categories of exposure to sediment contamination are shown in the bar plot. Category 1 is minimal exposure; Category 2 is low exposure; Category 3 is moderate exposure; and Category 4 is high exposure. Categories are determined by two prominent chemistry indices determined by analyzing a suite of chemical concentrations present in sediment samples. Missing bars represent no data. In minimal exposure, sediment-associated contamination may be present, but exposure is unlikely to result in effects. In low exposure, small increase in contaminant exposure may be associated with increased effects, but magnitude or frequency of occurrence of biological impacts is low. In moderate exposure, there is clear evidence of sediment contaminant exposure at concentrations that are likely to result in biological effects. For high exposure, contaminant exposure is highly likely to result in substantial biological effects. The Channel Islands have no sediments in Category 4 and the large majority of sediments are in Category 1 or 2, thus indicating limited contamination impact in sanctuary sediments. At this time, the suites of chemical indices have not yet been completed for the 2008 bight-wide survey. Figure: Schiff et al. 2011

## Figure App.F.14.5.

A map showing the presence (red) and absence (green) of a non-native encrusting invertebrate on oil platforms in the Santa Barbara Channel and around the Northern Channel Islands. CHECK

Presence (red) and absence (green) of _Watersipora spp._ on recently surveyed oil platforms, other artificial surfaces, and natural reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel. This non-indigenous bryozoan was found to occur on only two of 15 natural reefs surveyed in the northern Channel Islands. Figure: Page et al. 2016

## Figure App.F.15.1.

A series of figures showing the equally-common species for kelp forest fishes (top), mobile bottom-associated invetebrates (middle) and deep water fishes (bottom) around the four Northern Channel Islands from 2005 - 2014. CHECK

Mean annual effective number of species for three taxonomic groups: kelp forest fishes (top), mobile demersal invertebrates (middle), and deeper water fishes (bottom). Shannon-Weiner diversity was converted to effective numbers of species, which allows for a more direct and intuitive comparison of community diversity over time. Kelp forest fish were surveyed across 86 shallow reef sites (3 to 16 meters depth) around the four northern Channel Islands from 2005 to 2014. Mobile invertebrates were surveyed across 63 shallow reef sites (3 to 16 meters depth) around the four northern Channel Islands from 1982 to 2016. Deep-water fish were surveyed at three reefs off the Channel Islands (Piggy Bank, Footprint, and Anacapa passage) at depths ranging from 40 to 407 meters in 1995 and annually between 1998 and 2011. Error bars indicate the 95 percent confidence interval in a given year. The horizontal line is the mean across sites over time.

## Figure App.F.15.2.

A figure showing the temperature preferences for kelp-forest fish species across the four Northern Channel Islands. Anacapa and Santa Cruz Islands show a more southern (warmer) collection of fish species while Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands have a more northern (cooler) collection of fish species. 

The thermal ratio of the kelp forest fish assemblage shows the relative proportion of the fish community that have a southern (warmer) vs. northern (cooler) affiliation. Islands to the east, Anacapa (orange) and Santa Cruz (green), have a higher ratio of warm:cool species than Santa Rosa (blue) and San Miguel (purple), which are to the west. Santa Cruz Island is highly variable possibly because it is in a transition zone in the thermal gradient around the islands, which may make the fish community at this island more susceptible to the influence of climate changes. Note the log scale for the Y-axis.

## Figure App.F.15.3.

A figure showing the diversity of deep-sea corals across study sites in the Southern California Bight. 

Diversity of deep-sea corals at the eight study sites in southern California with the best ROV coverage, or research effort. The footprint (red) in the sanctuary ranks among the highest for biodiversity and abundance of deep-sea corals. Figure: Etnoyer et al. 2015

Left: a map showing the results of sediment contamination on invertebrate communities that live within the sediment. Right: a map showing a shift in sediment-dwelling invetebrate communites towards being more tolerant of sediment impacts based on a 2013 study

(Left) Infaunal invertebrate communities are characterized based on the proportion of a sediment sample with taxa that are sensitive (green, reference) as opposed to tolerant (red, high disturbance) of contaminant levels. (Right) In the most recent samples collected in 2013, ten of the 15 sites in Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary had an infaunal community composition that was shifting to that which is more tolerant of degraded conditions (red) compared to the samples collected previously.

## Table App.F.13.2.

A table displaying the common and scientific names of species used to identify trends in fishing effort (with one type of fishing, known as fixed gear fishing) in the Southern California Bight from 2009 - 2016.

Common and scientific names of species selected for calculation of recent trends in CPUE from NMFS NWFSC Hook and Line surveys in the Southern California Bight. Of the more than 50 different species encountered in surveys from 2004—2015, the 15 species that were encountered most often (top 15 ranked species) were selected with the exception of sanddabs and squarespot rockfish, which are not well sampled by this survey method. The trend in annual CPUE was determined for the period 2009—2015 and is shown as increasing (↗), decreasing (↘), or no trend (↔) at the three spatial scales shown in Figure App.F.13.20. Three targeted or protected species were also included: cowcod, canary, and yelloweye rockfish (Note: These species were rarely encountered so observed trends may be misleading). Most strong regional trends (Southern California Bight and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary region) are reflected at the CINMS-level. Regional recovery or recruitment-driven population increases appears to be occurring for several species, including lingcod and bank rockfish. Trends were not strong for some rare species (e.g., cowcod and yelloweye). The CINMS trend was different than the larger sampling area for some species (e.g., bocaccio, chilipepper, and greenspotted rockfish) possibly influenced by depth segregation, effects of the Channel Islands network of MPAs, or regional/site level-effects amplified by low sample sizes.

## Table App.F.13.3.

A table displaying the common and scientific names of species used to identify trends in fishing effort (with one type of fishing, known as trawl fishing) in the Southern California Bight from 2009 - 2016. 

Common and scientific names of species selected for calculation of recent trends in CPUE from NMFS NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Surveys in the Southern California Bight. Of the more than 247 different species encountered in surveys from 2003 to 2014, the 23 species that were encountered most often were selected. The trend in annual CPUE was determined for the period 2009–2014 and is shown as increasing (↗), decreasing (↘), or no trend (↔) at the three spatial scales shown in Figure App.F.13.21. Yellow highlights the 11 species that appear to be well sampled in trawls at the shallower depths most commonly surveyed inside Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (67 percent of sites in CINMS < 200 meters). These shallower species appear to be stable or increasing in CINMS and the surrounding region. Most species with different short-term trends at the smaller and larger spatial scales are deepwater species not sampled well in shallow water stations in CINMS.

## Table App.F.15.2.

A table showing trends in four indicators of [biodiversity](https://github.com/marinebon/cinms/blob/master/modals/_glossary.md) as they relate to the Southern California Bight, the area around Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and in the Sanctuary itself. 

Short-term trend in annual mean species richness, species density, Simpson diversity, and mean trophic level (MTL) for West Coast demersal fishes collected during the NMFS U.S. West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey from 2008 to 2014 at three spatial scales (see map Figure App.F.13.21). Species richness is the count of the number of species present in a net sample. Species density is the number of species per unit area. Simpson diversity takes into account the number of species present, as well as the relative abundance of each species. Mean trophic level is the biomass-weighted average trophic level of all species in a net sample. Short-term trends are consistent across all three spatial scales. Most diversity measures show declines in the near term, whereas MTL shows near-term increases. More Information about how these indicators were calculated are available at https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/Assets/iea/california/Report/pdf/3.Ecological%20Integrity_2013.pdf.
